## ABOUT

This project accesses the Spotipy API to access the 5 most recently played and recommendations for these songs. 
Upon clicking the cards of a song, it will promptly provide 5 recommendation tabs that the user can
observe. I plan on utilizing the 30 second clips that some tracks come with.

The current implementation serves as a base for future implementations and plan on adding to it in the future.
The frontend code can benefit from more organization and structure, but I am still trying to understand and 
get used to using React
